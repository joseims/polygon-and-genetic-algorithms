# Polygons and genetic algorithms

This is my small experiment with genetics Algorithms and polygons. My goal is to recreate an image using polygons.  

Each one of the versions are a try (mostly a bad one).

- **Version 1**-  My first take, i created it from scratch, got a regular result within a night of it running. (I do did some changes after seen roger's algorithms, but before coding the version 2 )

 - **Version 2** - It is [Roger Johansson Evo-lisa](https://rogerjohansson.blog/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/), the result are amazing (there is a link to his blog where i found the code)

- **Version 3** - Its purely version 2 + crossover. The result is pretty bad.

- **Version 4** - I reuse the structure from versions 3 and change the algorithms to be crossover oriented instead of mutation oriented.
