# Version 2 - Evo-lisa with crossover


As the title says, this is again [ Roger Johansson algorithm](https://rogerjohansson.blog/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/), Evo-Lisa, with crossover added, and the result is terrible.   
The crossover make the mutation algorithm oriented so slow, that the mutations doesnt even matter that much. I wont even post any result because they are meaningless.
