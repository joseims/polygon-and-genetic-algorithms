# Version 1 - The first take

This is my first take on genetic algorithms, i just coded it from scrath based on examples i saw and from books.  
I got a regular result in a really long time(12h).  
(I actually made some small changes seeing the Evo-lisa code, but before writing the version 2. And the image is actually before those changes, i made rerun it later)
