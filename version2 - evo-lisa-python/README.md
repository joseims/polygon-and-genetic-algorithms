# Version 2 - Evo-lisa in python

This is the [Roger Johansson's Evo-lisa algorithm](https://rogerjohansson.blog/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/) rewritten in python (this code doesn't belong to me), i did this to learn i little more about his algorithm and to learn OO python.  
 The mutation oriented genetic algorithm is pretty interesting and surprisingly effective.  
 From the things i notices that caught my eye is that he sets limits to the alpha channel and he makes the polygons start small.
