# Version 4 - Crossover oriented


This is probably will be my last take for a while, i will reuse the evo-lisa structure i coded, but i will take the mutation orientation out and make it crossover oriented. It look more a like with my first take. It starts with a  fixed number of polygons, use alpha limits, and start the polygons size small. 
  I will also change the polygons to triangles.
