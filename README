This is my small experiment with genetics Algorithms and polygons. My goal is to recreate an image using polygons.
Each one of the versions are a try (mostly a bad one).

Version 1-  My first take, i created it from scratch, got a regular result within a night of it running. (I do did some changes after seen roger's algorithms, but before coding the version 2 )

Version 2 - It is Roger Johansson Evo-lisa, the result are amazing (there is a link to his blog where i found the code)

Version 3 - Its purely version 2 + crossover. The result is pretty bad.

Version 4 - I reuse the structure from versions 2 and 3 and change the algorithms to be crossover oriented instead of mutation oriented.
